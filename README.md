Project live at [Chromatic](https://62b9bea77d96601ae1a601a9-yztyjkctwr.chromatic.com/)

The core focus of this part of the solution:  
- Create a small ui kit that can be installed via yarn/npm etc.

### Technologies and Libraries used

The core libraries are listed here:

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [CreatReactApp](https://create-react-app.dev/)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

ESLint and prettier are set up as combined config. Formatting will run as part of linting rules.

  bugs that you might have missed.
* Prettier - Formats the code.
* ESLint - Enforce som standards and rules. Basic configuration.

_Start Command_ `yarn start` (<a href="#usage">Refer to the usage section</a>)

### General
Given more time I would Implement the following.
