### Technologies and Libraries used

The core libraries are listed here:

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [CreatReactApp](https://create-react-app.dev/)
* [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

ESLint and prettier are set up as combined config. Formatting will run as part of linting rules.
